For Windows users, it is necessary to have an Apache server running and put the folder inside the "htdocs" directory.
Xampp ( https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/XAMPP%20Windows/8.2.12/xampp-windows-x64-8.2.12-0-VS16-installer.exe ) is a good multi-module control panel that has Apache already integrated and more.

When you have the running Apache server and the folder is in the htdocs directory (it should look like this: "c or other drives":\xampp\htdocs\MCrcon ), you can configure the software via the "config.php" (more details on rauks' page) and run it typing in your browser " localhost/MCrcon/index.php " as url.
